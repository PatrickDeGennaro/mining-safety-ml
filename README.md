# Worker Behavior Prediction System in Mining

## Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) project aimed at predicting workplace accidents in mining operations. By leveraging real-time data from personal monitoring devices and historical safety records, this project seeks to enhance worker safety through proactive risk identification.

## Problem Statement
Mining is one of the most hazardous industries, where accidents can lead to severe injuries or fatalities. Traditional safety measures are often reactive rather than predictive. This project aims to develop an ML-based system to anticipate potential accidents by analyzing worker behavior, environmental conditions, and historical incident data.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for accident prevention in mining operations.
- Utilize real-time and historical data to improve safety measures.
- Provide actionable insights for safety managers to mitigate risks proactively.

## Data Sources
The dataset for this project includes:
- **Personal Monitoring Devices**: Real-time sensor data on worker movements, heart rate, and environmental factors.
- **Historical Safety Records**: Past incident reports, near-misses, and safety compliance data.
- **Environmental Data**: Temperature, humidity, gas levels, and other site-specific conditions.
- **Operational Data**: Shift patterns, equipment usage, and worker fatigue levels.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying patterns and correlations in accident occurrences.
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Testing multiple ML models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM-based neural networks.
4. **Model Evaluation & Optimization**
   - Hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
5. **Deployment**
   - Integration with a web-based dashboard for real-time risk alerts.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, XGBoost
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Flask/FastAPI, Streamlit (optional for dashboard)

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved workplace safety through proactive risk management.
- Reduction in accident rates and near-misses.
- A scalable ML model that can be adapted to different mining sites.
